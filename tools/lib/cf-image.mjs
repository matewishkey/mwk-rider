// Cloudflare Image-Transformation URL helpers, shared by the offline (built HTML)
// and live (rendered HTML) image checks so both flag the same param anti-patterns.
//
// A transform URL is /cdn-cgi/image/<comma-separated-options>/<source>. We flag:
//   - explicit non-auto format (format=webp/avif/jpeg/…): no AVIF negotiation, and
//     onerror=redirect then serves the raw source to clients that don't accept it
//   - missing quality=: Cloudflare defaults to 85; an explicit cap (e.g. 80) is
//     usually a large win on photographic content
// Aliases per Cloudflare docs: format|f, quality|q. (Verified via context7.)


// The options segment between /cdn-cgi/image/ and the source path, or null.
export function transformOptions(src) {
  return src.match(/\/cdn-cgi\/image\/([^/]+)\//)?.[1] ?? null;
}

// { explicitFormat: <fmt|null>, missingQuality: <bool> }, or null if not a transform URL.
export function transformSmells(src) {
  const opts = transformOptions(src);
  if (opts == null) return null;
  const fmt = opts.match(/(?:^|,)(?:format|f)=([^,]+)/i)?.[1]?.toLowerCase();
  const hasQuality = /(?:^|,)(?:quality|q)=/i.test(opts);
  return {
    explicitFormat: fmt && fmt !== 'auto' ? fmt : null,
    missingQuality: !hasQuality,
  };
}

// Did the transform actually RUN?
//
// A `/cdn-cgi/image/` URL is a *request* for Cloudflare to transform something.
// Whether it did is only visible in the response, and the difference is not
// subtle — measured 2026-09-03 against a real site:
//
//   /cdn-cgi/image/width=800,format=auto,quality=80/…/hero-coastal.webp
//     200, content-type: image/webp, content-length: 71366
//     cf-resized: internal=ok/m q=0 n=372+145 c=22+37 v=2026.9.0 l=71366 …
//   the same file with the prefix removed
//     200, content-type: image/webp, content-length: 258874, NO cf-resized
//
// So `cf-resized` is the signal, and its absence on a 200 means the bytes came
// through untransformed. Transformations are a PER-ZONE toggle that has to be
// switched on (dashboard → Images → Transformations → pick the zone), so a site
// can emit perfectly-shaped transform URLs and serve none of them — which is
// exactly what this cannot be allowed to report as ✅.
//
// On failure the header carries `err=<code>` instead, and the codes are
// documented and actionable:
// https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/reference/troubleshooting/
